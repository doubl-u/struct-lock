A file encryption system that transforms data into 3D structural mappings for enhanced security. Unlike traditional encryption methods, Struct Lock organizes both content and keys within a virtual volumetric space, creating a multi-dimensional security layer.

## How to Use

### For End Users (Executable Version)
1. **Prepare your text**:
   - Open `file[].txt` (created automatically if missing)
   - Insert the text you want to encrypt
   - Save the file

2. **Run the executable**:
   ```bash
   ./StructLock.exe  # Windows
   ./StructLock      # Linux
   
## Key Features

- **3D Structural Mapping**: Encodes data into a virtual cube lattice where:
  - Plaintext occupies core positions
  - Encryption keys are embedded in surface planes
  - Dynamic axis expansion accommodates variable data sizes

- **Dual-Phase Security**:
  1. Dictionary-based character substitution
  2. Geometric spatial obfuscation

- **Self-Contained**:
  - Encrypted files contain all necessary decryption components
  - No external key files required

## How It Works

1. **Encryption Process**:
   ```plaintext
   Input Text → Character Substitution → 3D Spatial Mapping → Embedded Key Output
2. **Decryption Process**:
   ```plaintext
   Encrypted File → Structural Analysis → Key Extraction → Reverse Mapping → Original Text
